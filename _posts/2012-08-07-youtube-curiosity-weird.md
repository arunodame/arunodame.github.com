This is occurred when I was watching (around 2012-08-07 06:08 GMT) the [Curiosity's Descent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcGMDXy-Y1I&feature=youtu.be) video on youtube. Although it lacks the quality it was a great one. This post is not about that. But something weird on the youtube statistics for this video.

* Total views: 302
