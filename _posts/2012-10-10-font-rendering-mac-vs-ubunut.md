but I'm having some bad luck with font rendering in Mac compared with Ubuntu."

I have been using Ubuntu for a while. Despite minor issues, Ubuntu works great for me. (Luckily I had no big issues with the hardware). But I wanted to try a Mac and I recently bought a Mac Book Pro with Mountain Lion.

Everything is good, I had no issues with apps I use, including dev apps. And it has some great hardware which is the another reason why I picked a one. 

Font Rendering
--------------

For a developer like me, font rendering is very important since, I always work with code, read stuff and do many things with letters most of the time. Ubuntu renders font really good and it's **ubuntu** font is really cool. After installing Windows fonts, It looks really cool on the web too.

For me Mac's font rendering looks so weired mostly on the Web. I copied windows fonts to the fonts folder as I did in Ubuntu but still no luck.

I hope things will be better with next releases.

See the difference with following screenshots, captured in both Mac and Ubuntu.
